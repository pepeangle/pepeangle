ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @pepeangle. This is just a quick steps showing how to buy rarepepes assets with Bitcoin (BTC) using Counterparty(XCP) wallets.

#### 1. Create Counterparty Wallet 
- Since **rarepepes** are assets on CounterParty (which is running on Bitcoin blockchain) we need to download a CounterParty wallet. I recommend  ([FreeWallet](https://freewallet.io)) since it support most platforms.
- Download & install wallet --> Open Wallet --> Click on `Create New Wallet`. The wallet should show you passphrase of 12 words. You must write this down on the paper and **keep it as secrets for yourself**.
